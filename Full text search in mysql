FUll text search
    ->> full text search is nothing but the like the google, bing search, if you are searching with a keyword like "car" and "model" it would fetch the data from the keyword of car or model
    it is like partial searching
    
    For example, you can search for Wood and Metal, FTS can return results that contain the searched words separately, just Wood or Metal, or results that contain the words in a different order Word and Metal, or Metal and Wood.
